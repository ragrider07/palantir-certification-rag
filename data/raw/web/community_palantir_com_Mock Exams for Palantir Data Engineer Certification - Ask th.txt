Hey,
Is there any availability of test papers to practice for the exam to get certified in Palantir Data Engineering?
Would be glad to receive any guidance on how could I best prep for the test. I’ve just looked at the guide and have been studying the documentation and youtube videos.
Best,
Siddharth
Is there a way to get certified without Taking Ontology ‘Official’ training course ?, like:
