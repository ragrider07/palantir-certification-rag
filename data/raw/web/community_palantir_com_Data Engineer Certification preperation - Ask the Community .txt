If you could share any pointers regarding Data Engineer Certification preparation.
I have seen the guide https://learn.palantir.com/data-engineer-guide-2023/1388785
But, was thinking if you have any materials, best practices and mock up tests
Hi @bedideanil - thank you for reaching out! The Exam Guide is currently all the preparation materials that we share publicly. I would also recommend looking through  topics covered on the Data Engineer Training Track. We also generally recommend users have a few months of independent work building on the platform in order to best prepare them for the exams; however, experience needs vary per user.
Hope this helps!
Garrett
